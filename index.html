            My favourite hobby is coding. I love coding because Iam learning many new and interesting things. I have learnt to create many games and apps in different platforms like code.org, thunkable, codepen.io etc. My teacher teaches me coding very well. Coding has intrigued me to develop more apps and games for the society. It has also changed my perspective towards apps like if I play any game now I only think how the app would have been coded. A few months ago I didn't know to code at all but now it is my favourite hobby. ~_~ </p>
